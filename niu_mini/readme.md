# My Layout

The NIU Mini has the same layout as the Planck: 4x12 ortholinear with an optional 2u spacebar. For mine, the PCB socket for the top right most key was busted so I ran some jumper wires from that to the right "spacebar." That's why the layouts are a little weird, all the top right keys are KC_NO and then whatever is to the right of the spacebar goes in the top right.

Based on Noah Frederick's [Planck layout](https://noahfrederick.com/log/the-planck-keyboard). I really like having the symmetric parentheses, brackets, braces, and angle brackets.
